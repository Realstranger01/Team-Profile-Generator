### Description

A Test Driven Development CLI application using Node.js that takes input from the user, in this case a team manager, about employees on a software engineering team. Once the team manager is finished entering in the names, ID's, email's and GitHub profiles the application generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

### Usage

Check out my video tutorial here [Team-Profile-Generator](./assets/Untitled_%20Mar%201%2C%202023%204_42%20PM.webm) 

### What I Learned

I learned that Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes writing automated tests before writing the actual code. This approach helps to ensure that the code meets the specified requirements and is free from bugs.
I also learned that the application is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of creating employee summaries by automating the process. Additionally, the use of Node.js as a programming language and the ability to generate an HTML webpage suggest that the application can be easily integrated into other web applications.

Overall, this project highlights the importance of using TDD in software development to ensure quality and accuracy, as well as the benefits of using modern programming languages and technologies like Node.js and HTML.
